# NHLStats
A collection of R scripts that aim to clean, reformat, and analyze game data from the 2024-2025 NHL season.

## Data Sources
The data in this repository currently consists of 32 Excel files, each containing the game-by-game stats of one NHL team from the 2024-2025 NHL season. All of these files were obtained directly from QuantHockey.com.

Should you want to view this data directly from the source, you can see it at https://www.quanthockey.com/nhl/team-game-logs/ottawa-senators-2024-25-nhl-game-log.html (replace ottawa-senators with the name of the team you want to see stats for).
